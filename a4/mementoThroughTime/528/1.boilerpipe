The WTO and China: Hands slapped
A ruling with ramificationsWHEN China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in late 2001, its share of world exports stood at 4.3%. By last year that share had soared to 10.6%, and the country had become the world’s biggest exporter. In addition to awe and envy, its rise has spawned a rapidly growing list of trade quarrels. China was a party to only two of the 93 trade disputes that were taken to the WTO between its accession and the end of 2005. But in the five years to the end of 2010, it was involved in 26 of the 84 cases filed at the forum. On July 5th the WTO’s dispute-settlement body found against China on three linked complaints. The cases were brought by America, the European Union and Mexico in 2009 and took issue with China’s policy of restricting the exports of certain industrial raw materials, including bauxite, magnesium, zinc and silica, of which it is a leading producer. The plaintiffs argued that China’s policies gave domestic firms that use these commodities an unfair competitive advantage, while also restricting world supply of these inputs and causing their prices to soar. ...
Global house prices: Rooms with a view
Asia’s frothiest housing markets are calming down. Is America’s bottoming?THE bubble that caused a global recession has been a long time deflating. The American housing market began to decline half a decade ago and hasn’t stopped yet. Prices dropped by 5.1% from the year before, according to the latest S&P/Case-Shiller national index. Among markets tracked by The Economist, only Irish homes have fallen further since 2006. Robert Shiller, one of the fathers of the Case-Shiller index, says more hard times lie ahead. Prices may slide another 10-25%, he reckons, as the economy wrings out the excess supply of the bubble years.By our calculations, however, America’s housing market has overshot the fair-value mark, as measured by the long-run average ratio of house prices to rents. Rents are rising: an increase in the cost of rental housing contributed to May’s robust American inflation data. With home ownership looking a better deal, prices should stabilise. The Case-Shiller index posted a month-on-month increase in April for the first time since July 2010. It was not alone in showing gains. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) price series ticked up in April for the first time since May 2010, and the CoreLogic index of home prices, a favourite of the Federal Reserve, notched price rises in both April and May. The pace of sales has been sluggish but an index of pending home sales posted a surprisingly large gain in May. ...
Economics focus: Less haste, more freed
Experience suggests Greece’s privatisation plan is too fastWITH a target of €50 billion ($72 billion) by 2015, Greece’s privatisation plan aims to raise more cash as a share of GDP than any OECD government has managed before. If the goal for listed companies is met, the market capitalisation of the Athens stock exchange would double. The economic benefits of privatisation are widely accepted: a 2003 OECD study found “overwhelming support” for the idea that “privatisation brings about a significant increase in the profitability, real output and efficiency of privatised companies.” But is Greece’s timetable too rapid?Most privatisation programmes involve a trade-off between long-term structural reform and short-term fund-raising. In Greece’s case, there is an urgent need for money. Lenders want Greece to raise as much of it as possible so they can limit the amount they have to fork out in the next bail-out; the IMF hopes that asset sales will mean less growth-sapping austerity.  ...
