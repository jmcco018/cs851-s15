Former NFL wide receiver Brandon Lloyd has role in zombie flick
The New England Patriots could really use the services of a halfway decent veteran wide receiver, and there aren?t many worth bringing in. Brandon Lloyd would be perfect, since he already knows the Pats offense. Only problem is that Lloyd?Read more ?
Did Ray Rice spit on Phil Taylor?
Ray Rice is known as one of football?s good guys. He is philanthropically active off the field and seems like a genuinely nice dude. Despite that, the Ravens? running back may be in a bit of hot water after Browns defensive tackle Phil Taylor insisted that Rice spit on him during their game this past Sunday. Pro Football Talk has more: � Cleveland Browns defensive tackle�Phil Taylor�picked up a 15-yard penalty in Sunday?s game against the Baltimore Ravens for slapping running back�Ray Rice�in the helmet. Taylor wouldn?t say what led him to hit Rice but�hinted that Rice spit him on. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said Monday he didn?t see any evidence that Rice spit on Taylor but Taylor is firm in his belief that Rice followed the example of former Baltimore Orioles player Roberto Alomar. A league source tells PFT?s Mike Florio that Taylor insists that Rice did spit on him and that there is video evidence to prove it that will be sent to the league office for review. Can?t wait for ...
Terrelle Pryor rips THE Ohio State University
Terrelle Pryor is just starting to make his mark in the NFL ? he gained his first victory this weekend as starting quarterback for the Oakland Raiders, and has the opportunity to establish himself as one of the league?s promising young quarterbacks. However, he is still better known for his college days and is often asked about his career with the Ohio State Buckeyes. After the win over the Jaguars this weekend, Pryor had some harsh commentary about his former school. Per The Columbus Dispatch:  ?That?s my school, but they don?t really accept me. I?ve moved on to what I have now, and that?s just football. [...] Those guys kicked me out of school after all those things I did for them.?  An Oakland official stepped in after the comments and directed questions back to Pryor?s NFL career. Pryor?s time at Ohio State resulted in the bowl ban for the Buckeyes as part of NCAA sanctions for the infamous tattoo scandal. However, he also amassed a 31-4 record during his time at the school and ...
Pac 12 admits Pac 12 refs screwed Wisconsin
If you stayed up late enough to watch it unfold live, you probably went to bed scratching your head. If you went to bed early, like me, and were astounded by the controversy you woke up to you probably felt the same way. The way in how Wisconsin's road game at Arizona State ended is certainly not one that made a whole lot of sense and everybody seemed to go about it wrong, including the Pac 12 refs. On Monday the Pac 12 addressed the way the game was handled by their refs and basically admitted their refs screwed Wisconsin out of an opportunity to win.   According to a conference release, "Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has reprimanded and taken additional sanctions against officials in Saturday night's Wisconsin at Arizona State game for failing to properly administer the end of game situation and act with appropriate urgency on the game's final play." In simple terms, Scott said the refs goofed and a game was likely decided by that unfortunate sequence.   Ul...
Was this Dennis Rodman pistachio commercial done in poor taste?
Sometimes, the wacky stuff we find here on That NBA Lottery Pick doesn?t really need any sort of long form explanation. Check out Dennis Rodman?s brand-new ?Wonderful Pistachio? commercial which features him and a actor pretending to be Kim Jong-Un  *** Dennis Rodman image courtesy of Getty Images
Josh Freeman denies that he\'ll demand a trade
Despite previous reports to the contrary, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman is denying that he will ask for a trade away from the team. The Bucs have refused to give Freeman a contract extension, despite the fact that he?s in the final year of his current deal. The team also drafted N.C. State signal-caller Mike Glennon in the 2013 NFL Draft. Freeman claims he has no plans to seek a trade and ?if it?s going on I need a new camp.? We can assume that means that if someone in his ?camp? is demanding a trade he needs to get rid of them.  Freeman was not named a captain for this season and speculation claimed it was because he had missed some meetings. Head coach Greg Schiano has denied that was a reason for it. The Bucs are now 0-2 on the season after an awful performance in a 16-14 loss to the Saints on Sunday. The 25-year-old quarterback completed just 9-of-22 passes for 125 yards against the Saints, with one touchdown and an interception. So far on the season he has compl...
Nationals-Braves game postponed due to DC Navy Yard shooting
The Washington Nations have postponed Monday night?s game against the Braves, due to the shooting at Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters, which is a few blocks away from Nationals Park. The Braves and Nationals will play a split doubleheader Tuesday to make up the game.� The games will start at 1:05 p.m. ET and 7:05 p.m. ET.� The announcement was made around 3:15 p.m. ET. ?All of us here in the Nationals organization were deeply saddened to learn of the tragic events that occurred this morning only a few blocks from Nationals Park,? the team said in a statement. ?Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.? According to the latest reports, 12 people are dead and others wounded at the hands of a shooter who entered the place on Monday morning.� The latest reports have also speculated that there could be additional gunmen that may be loose in the area. ?The safety of our fans is our utmost priority,? the team?s statement said. ?As we have throughout the day, ...
Dumping Bo Pelini is no easy task for Nebraska
?Nebraska?s defense utterly collapsed in the second half of a game the Huskers were controlling.? I don?t have that sentence saved in AutoText but I should. You saw it, I saw it, and Tommie Frazier saw it, which led to the Husker legend calling for a solution: firing the entire defensive staff. In fact, he may have even gone further than that, calling for Nebraska to ?get rid of the defensive play caller, the Dc, lb dl and db coaches.?� That sounds like he might have even been calling for Bo Pelini himself to get fired. Even If Frazier didn?t call for Pelini?s firing, though, plenty among the Husker faithful wouldn?t mind a bit if that happened. Now, I love the history of college football, so when I see a situation like this arise, I look for historical precedents. Past events are not always predictive of the future but they do help us find some kind of understanding. I couldn?t find any recent instance of a head coach firing his entire staff on one side of the ball. Steve Sarkisian...
