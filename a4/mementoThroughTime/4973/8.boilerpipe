satansvalium asked: your blog is really good.. how long have you had it for? are the photos your own?
ANSWER: Thank you, that is a much appreciated compliment.
I started this tumblr on March 27th of last year, so I guess about 10 months. I take most of the pictures on here, not all but most.
Thanks again, JM
