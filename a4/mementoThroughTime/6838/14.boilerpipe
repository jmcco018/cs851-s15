When married couple and freelance designers Emma and Brandon Peat had their first child, they wanted a fun way to teach their newborn the alphabet.
By taking their favorite film franchise—Star Wars—they have recreated the entire alphabet list featuring characters from the original Star Wars trilogy—with each alphabet representing a different character.
Called ‘A is for Ackbar’, the entire list was a collaboration between the married couple—with Mr. Peat sketching the characters and Mrs. Peat in-charge of coloring.
Wouldn’t it be cool to have such ‘geeky’ parents?
