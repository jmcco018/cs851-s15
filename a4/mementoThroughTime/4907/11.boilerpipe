Prince Harry's sporting initiative, the Invictus Games, is coming to London this September offering the public a unique opportunity to get behind our wounded warriors. This video sees celebrities such as Daniel Craig, Stephen Fry, Joss Stone, Will.i.am and many more reciting the hauntingly powerful poem Invictus in support of those Servicemen and women in rehabilitation, post injury.
