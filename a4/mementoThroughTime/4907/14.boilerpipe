Ikea: Where good Days start
Tom Rijpert
In a four minute film we tell the story of a family of five, getting through their morning routine, starting up the day. At every moment in the film the user can pause the film, and dive off into over 20 different mini-films, animations, or interactive elements. The challenge was to make the film work on it's own, as well as tell a broader story combined with all the interactive content.
