** Thanks for all the great responses and feedback! I appreciate all the messages but I couldn't possibly respond to them all, so here's a big Shukran (Thank you) to all! **
This is the first in a series of arabic language lessons, which will cover the written language and then speech. This lesson is a two parter and contains the basic isolated consonant forms. Stay tuned for the next installation, where you will learn how to write basic words and how the isolated consonants change shape depending on where they are in the word.
Learning Arabic is not as hard as you'd think if you have a good system. I've had to pick up bits and pieces here and there and it is my hope that by bringing them together and sharing them, others will be able to quickly learn how to master this beautiful language. ( more ) ( less )
