zigzagstitches' Shop Announcement
**ORDERS PLACED AFTER NOVEMBER 22 WILL SHIP ON NOVEMBER 30**
A Boxy Bag is perfect for carrying a small knitting or crochet project. My Drawstring Bags have padded lining to allow them to stand on their own, and to prevent knitting needles from poking through. The Spindle Bags are padded to protect your precious drop spindle.
