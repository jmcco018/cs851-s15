Do you believe in love?
The question is who doesn't. Jk. To be honest, I'm not really into the grandiose aspect of love. Let's just say that I dwell on the commitment side of any relationship and not much on the romantic part.

Balaclava-clad raider pulls 2ft sword on betting shop staff
Police have released CCTV footage of the moment a balaclava-clad raider    threatens betting shop staff with a 2ft sword.
The offender struck a computer screen and knocked over displays at Coral    bookmakers opposite Burnley FC's Turf Moor ground as he terrorised two    employees with his demands for cash.
He then jumped over the counter and stole between £150 and £200 from the till    of the shop before it is thought he made off.
The incident took place at about 8.45pm on Monday, July 21 last year.
The raider is described as white, 5ft 10in, with a slim build, who was wearing    a grey tracksuit top with a logo on the top of the hood and dark tracksuit    bottoms.
He spoke with a local accent, police added.
DC Dave Greenwood of Pennine CID, said: "This was a violent and    aggressive attack which left two members of staff terrified and fearful for    their own safety.
"It has been some time since the initial incident but we remain    determined to identify the man responsible and hope that someone who views    the footage may hold important information about his identity."
