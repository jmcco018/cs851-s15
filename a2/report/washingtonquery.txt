Zirkel/iStock) Robert J. LaBombard, the CEO for GradStaff, Inc., says graduates miss out on opportunities because smaller companies don’t have the resources to recruit on campus, and college career counseling hasn’t kept up with an evolving job market. His company provides a college recruiting program to help hiring companies fill entry-level positions. Here’s his take:Colleges Must Adapt to Changing Entry-Level Job MarketLauren and Matt graduated from college in December 2013. Both had marketable degrees – Lauren in marketing and Matt in business management. Lauren started a job right after graduating, but it wasn’t the right fit and [she] was back in the job market after a few months. Matt was active in his job search before and after graduating, but struggled to get interviews and find the right fit.By June 2014 they were frustrated and discouraged. Ultimately, both sought outside expertise and, with the right guidance, landed management trainee positions with a medium-sized firm specializing in technology and healthcare equipment financing. Lauren and Matt love their jobs and readily admit they never would have found this opportunity on their own – or through their respective colleges.With only 17 percent of May 2014 grads having jobs at graduation last year, the experiences of Lauren and Matt are not isolated examples. With more than 4 of 5 new grads leaving college without a job, their experience is the norm for the vast majority of new grads.Yet, after five years of recovery, our economy is finally growing and companies are hiring. With baby boomers rapidly retiring, demographics in their favor, and companies thirsting for technology skills, the market for new college grads should be booming. Unfortunately, the reality says otherwise.The problem is that the entry-level job market has changed, but colleges have not adapted.Large employers still dominate on-campus recruiting, but conversations with career services professionals and HR executives indicate that on-campus recruiting, aided by technology, is now very targeted and primarily focused on STEM grads or those liberal arts majors in the top 10 percent of their classes.However, small and medium employers – not large companies – are driving job growth. According to ADP’s monthly employment reports, nearly 75 percent of new jobs filled in 2014 have been with companies of 500 employees or less. Unfortunately, due to the cost of on-campus recruiting, these employers don’t interview on campus.My company hired more than 1,000 college grads in 2014. As part of our interview process, candidates completed a questionnaire to help us understand their career interests and what they have experienced in their job search to date. Only 20 percent of our applicants used their career services department “very often” and more than 40 percent said they used career services “rarely” or “never.” Additionally, 65 percent identified “not knowing what jobs are a fit” as a significant obstacle in their job searches.What does all this data mean? For one thing, the average new grad job seeker is not engaging career services for assistance. Further, because a large majority of candidates don’t know which jobs fit their skills, their job searches are unfocused and not strategic. As a consequence, the results are poor and we are left with a very inefficient market – qualified job seekers and hiring companies that can’t find each other.Colleges have not kept pace with changes in the new grad job market, and many graduating seniors are woefully unprepared to find a job. Now is the time to look at the role and mission of career services on the college campus. Are students and new grads getting their money’s worth?The historic career services model is one of providing career and job search guidance to students, with a secondary goal of assisting employers who want to recruit at the college. This passive approach places the responsibility for finding a job exclusively on the student or grad. Colleges should be doing a lot more to help, and here are some suggestions:- Colleges should provide career counseling and job search training starting on day one. Finding a job is a lifelong skill that most of us will use eight times or more during our careers. Each student should be required to complete coursework providing education on the job market, where specific majors can be applied in the workforce, how to identify one’s transferrable skills, how to construct a résumé, how to interview, how to network, etc.- Staff career services with professionals who know something about the job market. The mission of career services must change to meet the needs of job seekers. Not only should the career services function provide career coaching and guidance, but it also should hire people with practical job market expertise who are experienced in connecting job seekers and hiring companies.- Improve outreach to the small/medium employer market. These are the companies creating jobs. Use virtual career fairs and video interviewing technology to schedule interview days for employers. Enlist alumni to assist, as many will be working for small and medium employers.- Create internship opportunities for undergrads. Internships significantly improve the marketability of new grads. According to new data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, those having a professional internship have a much better chance of having a job when they graduate. More internships need to be created and colleges should be more aggressive in working with employers to create them.- Evaluate colleges based on published job placement statistics. Few colleges publish truly helpful job placement statistics. Each year, colleges should quantify the number of grads going to grad school, the number employed in professional positions using their degrees and the number unemployed or underemployed. The competition will be good for everyone.- Be open to innovative third party intermediaries who know how to connect new grads and hiring companies. While some type of vetting process should be employed, there are firms with significant expertise in helping new grads figure out where they fit in the work force, identify important transferable skills, and identify potential employers. Some colleges may even want to completely outsource the career services function to experts in job placement.Colleges must respond with more innovative ways to bring these two parties together. With the right strategies, colleges can play an important role in making the market for new college grads much more efficient.Lauren and Matt show that success is attainable when the right coaching and guidance is provided.Susan Svrluga is a reporter for the Washington Post, covering higher education for the Grade Point blog.

They are, however, universal texts that are applicable to any conflict, and a reminder that the basic elements of war do not change with time.The cycle begins with a mother sending a child off to war and ends with a father's discovery of a son, long gone. In between are the stories of a soldier's death, a leader's hopes, and the marking of great loss.In order to represent the universal effects of war, I set poems by men and women, about life and death, and from the famous to the unknown. \"Civil Words\" is dedicated, with great admiration and appreciation, to Thomas Hampson.â€”Jennifer HigdonThe world premiere will be given by baritone Thomas Hampson and pianist Wolfram Rieger on February 9, 2015. Get an early glimpse of the text below.â€œCivil Wordsâ€?Jennifer Higdon (b. 1962)Enlisted TodayAnonymous Civil War recruitment poster.I know the sun shines, and the lilacs are blowing,And the summer sends kisses by beautiful May â€”Oh! to see all the treasures the spring is bestowing,And think my boy Willie enlisted today.It seems but a day since at twilight, low humming,I rocked him to sleep with his cheek upon mine,While Robby, the four-year old, watched for the comingOf father, adown the street's indistinct line.It is many a year since my Harry departed,To come back no more in the twilight or dawn:And Robby grew weary of watching, and startedAlone on the journey his father had gone.It is many a year â€” and this afternoon sittingAt Robby's old window, I heard the band play,And suddenly ceased dreaming over my knitting,To recollect Willie is twenty today.And that, standing beside him this soft May-day morning,And the sun making gold of his wreathed cigar smoke,I saw in his sweet eyes and lips a faint warning,And choked down the tears when he eagerly spoke:\"Dear mother, you know how these Northmen are crowing,They would trample the rights of the South in the dust,The boys are all fire; and they wish I were going â€”\"He stopped, but his eyes said. \"Oh, say if I must!\"I smiled on the boy, though my heart it seemed breaking,My eyes filled with tears, so I turned them away,And answered him, \"Willie, 'tis well you are waking â€”Go, act as your father would bid you, today!\"I sit in the window, and see the flags flying,And drearily list to the roll of the drum,And smother the pain in my heart that is lyingAnd bid all the fears in my bosom be dumb.And if he should fall â€”his young life he has givenFor freedom's sweet sake; and for me, I will prayOnce more with my Harry and Robby in HeavenTo meet the dear boy that enlisted today.All Quiet (from â€œAll Quiet Along the Potomac Tonightâ€?)Thaddeus Oliver\"All quiet along the Potomac to-night!\"Except now and then a stray picketIs shot as he walks on his beat, to and fro,By a rifleman hid in the thicket.'Tis nothing! A private or two now and thenWill not count in the news of the battle;Not an officer lost! Only one of the menMoaning out all alone, the death rattle.All quiet along the Potomac to-night!Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;And their tents in the rays of the clear autumn moon,And the light of their camp-fires are gleaming.Union soldiers guarding the Potomac River in 1861.A tremulous sigh, as a gentle night-windThrough the forest leaves slowly is creeping;While the stars up above, with their glittering eyes,Keep guard oâ€™er the army while sleeping.There's only the sound of the line sentry's tread,As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,And thinks of the two in the low trundle bed,Far away, in the cot on the mountain.His musket falls slack, and his face, dark and grim,Grows gentle with memories tender,As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep,And their mother â€“ â€œmay heaven defend her!â€?The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then -That night when the love, yet unspoken,Leaped up to his lips, and when low-murmured vowsWere pledged to be ever unbroken.Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,He dashes off tears that are welling;And gathers his gun closer up to his breast,As if to keep down the heartâ€™s swelling.He passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree,The footstep is lagging and weary;Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light,Towards the shades of the forest so dreary.Hark! Was it the night wind that rustled the leaves?Was it moonlight so wondrously flashing?It looks like a rifle: \"Ah! Mary, good-bye!\"And the life-blood is ebbing and splashing.â€œAll quiet along the Potomac to-night!â€?No sound save the rush of the river;While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead,And the picket's off duty forever!Lincolnâ€™s Final (from the 2nd Inagugural Address)Abraham LincolnFondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mightyscourge of war may speedily pass away.With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmnessIn the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive onto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nationâ€™s wounds;to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for hiswidow, and his orphan â€“ to do all which may achieve andcherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and withall nations.Final portrait of Abraham Lincoln taken on April 10, 1865. The Death of LincolnWilliam Cullen BryantOh, slow to smite and swift to spare,Gentle and merciful and just!Who, in the fear of God, didst bearThe sword of power, a nationâ€™s trust!In sorrow by thy bier we stand,Amid the awe that hushes all,And speak the anguish of a landThat shook with horror at thy fall.Thy task is done; the bond are free:We bear thee to an honored grave,Whose proudest monument shall beThe broken fetters of the slave.Pure was thy life; its bloody closeHath placed thee with the sons of light,Among the noble host of thoseWho perished in the cause of Right.Driving Home (from â€œDriving Home the Cowsâ€?)Kate Putman OsgoodOut of the clover and blue-eyed grassHe turned them into the river-lane;One after another he let them pass,Then fastened the meadow bars again.Under the willows, and over the hill,He patiently followed their sober pace;The merry whistle for once was still,And something shadowed the sunny face.Only a boy! and his father had saidHe never could let his youngest go:Two already were lying deadUnder the feet of the trampling foe.Drummer boys of the 93rd Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry.But after the evening work was done,And the frogs were loud in the meadow swamp,Over his shoulder he slung his gun,And stealthily followed the footpath damp.Across the clover and through the wheat,With resolute heart and purpose grim,Though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet,And the blind batâ€™s flitting startled him.Thrice since then had the lanes been white,And the orchards sweet with apple-bloom;And now, when the cows came back at night,The feeble father drove them home.For news had come to the lonely farmThat three were lying where two had lain;And the old manâ€™s tremulous, palsied armCould never lean on a sonâ€™s again.The summer day grew cool and late.He went for the cows when the work was done;But down the lane, as he opened the gate,He saw them coming one by one,Brindle, Ebony, Speckle, and Bess,Shaking their horns in the evening wind;Cropping the buttercups out of the grass,But who was it following close behind?Loosely swung in the idle airThe empty sleeve of army blue;And worn and pale, from the crisping hair,Looked out a face that the father knew.For the Southern prisons will sometimes yawn,And yield their dead unto life again;And the day that comes with a cloudy dawnIn golden glory at last may wane.The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes;For the heart must speak when the lips are dumb:And under the silent evening skiesTogether they followed the cattle home.Thomas Hampson Monday, February 9 at 8 PMThomas HampsonWolfram Riegerâ€œHampson has the extraordinary capacity to capture the poetic essence of a song and convey it directly to the listenerâ€™s mind and heart,â€? wrote The Washington Post of baritone Thomas Hampson. He brings his remarkable vocal gifts to Carnegie Hall in a not-to-be-missed recital.Tags:Thomas Hampson, Jennifer Higdon, Civil WarBlog SearchÃ— powered byCustom SearchSort by:RelevanceRelevanceDateWeb   Popular NowHelp Us Solve This Beatles MysteryNYO-USA Tours China with Dutoit and YUNDITune In: Thomas Hampson RecitalRemembering Florence Foster JenkinsCivil Words50 Shades of TallisBeethoven's Symphony No. 5: Personal or Political?Edgard VarÃ¨se: Liberator of Sound#AskJoyceWhen Ravel Met GershwinArchive2015 (42)January (15)February (27)2014 (253)January (18)February (27)March (25)April (21)May (22)June (11)July (28)August (17)September (23)October (37)November (15)December (9)2013 (302)January (21)February (38)March (21)April (28)May (20)June (14)July (40)August (28)September (21)October (25)November (26)December (20)2012 (311)February (7)March (57)April (38)May (28)June (28)July (16)August (15)September (18)October (42)November (42)December (20)Upcoming EventsMar3Blue Period EnsembleWeill Recital Hall8 PMLearn More  |  Buy NowMar3Keith Jarrett, Solo Piano ImprovisationsStern Auditorium / Perelman Stage8 PMLearn More  Mar4Carnegie Hall PresentsNeighborhood Concert: NOW EnsemblePregones Theater7 PMLearn More  Carnegie HallHomeEnsemble ACJWHistoryBlogVideosThe ShopCalendar & TicketsMonthly CalendarBuy TicketsStudent TicketsTicketing PoliciesGift CertificatesInformationAbout UsDirections to the HallParking in the AreaTours of the HallPress CenterHall RentalsJobsEducation & CommunityOverviewFor the CommunityFor Students and TeachersFor Young MusiciansDigital LibraryConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterFollow us on YouTubeSupport the HallMake a DonationBecome a MemberSpecial EventsSaluting Our Major SponsorsTerms & Conditions | Privacy PolicyÂ© 2015 Carnegie Hall Corporation | 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, New York City"

Except that a few days of rest do not stop the pain: “You’re just expected to keep going.” Trying to “man up”, he sought little help for his condition, choosing to hide it instead. “It all gets so debilitating that you don’t want to go on,” he explains.In this sectionAn awful holeBleeding red and blueTarnished SilverUnearthing Moscow’s molesIncentives matterWatching fruit rotOf vaccines and vacuous starletsWhere medics make the mostThe end zoneReprintsHe tried to kill himself more than once; fortunately, his attempts came to nothing. But the same cannot be said for a growing share of Americans. The suicide rate has risen from 11 per 100,000 people in 2005 to 13 seven years later. In the time it takes you to read this article, six Americans will try to kill themselves; in another ten minutes one will succeed.Over 40,000 Americans took their own lives in 2012—more than died in car crashes—says the American Association of Suicidology. Mondays in May see the most incidents. The rates are highest in Wyoming and Montana, perhaps because guns—which are more effective than pills—are so common there (see chart). Nationally, guns are used in half of all successful suicides.What drives people to self-destruction? Those who suffer from depression are, unsurprisingly, most at risk. The suicide rate also rises when times are hard. During the Depression it jumped to a record 19 per 100,000. It grew after the recent financial crisis too. “Even just uncertainty over employment” makes people worry a lot, notes Yeats Conwell, a psychiatrist at the University of Rochester Medical Centre.Audio and Video content on Economist.com requires a browser that can handle iFrames.The over-75s have historically been most likely to kill themselves, especially if they are lonely or ill. But now it is the middle-aged who are most at risk. In 2012 the suicide rate for Americans aged 45-54 was 20 per 100,000—the highest rate of any age group. For those aged 55-64 it was 18; for the over-65s it was 15. The middle years can be stressful, because that is when people realise that their youthful ambitions will never be fulfilled.Women make nearly four times as many suicide attempts as men, but men succeed four times as often. Men favour bloodier methods: most use a gun, whereas less than a third of women do. Women may be better at asking for help; overall, they are two and a half times more likely than men to take anti-depressants. Whites are nearly three times as likely as African-Americans to kill themselves. Blacks are five times more likely to be murdered with a gun than to kill themselves with one; for whites it is the other way round.Military veterans are especially prone to suicide. Data from 48 states suggest that 30 out of 100,000 veterans kill themselves each year—a rate far higher than among civilians. Many find it hard to overcome the trauma of combat, or to adjust to civilian life. A survey by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, an advocacy group, found that 31% of veterans had considered taking their own lives. Congress is mulling a bill to overhaul how the Department of Veterans Affairs handles the problem.Activists say the government does too little to prevent suicide. Christine Moutier of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention complains that only $40m of federal funding will go to anti-suicide programmes this year. This does not include the billions the government spends on mental-health problems more broadly.Some treatments, such as anti-depressants, are often quite effective. More than 20 studies have found that when anti-depressants are more widely available, fewer people end their own lives. For example, between 1991 and 1996 Swedes swallowed 240% more anti-depressants and the suicide rate fell 19%. But it is hard to prove a causal link. And other studies suggest that certain anti-depressants lead young people to think more about suicide.Making it slightly harder to kill yourself is also surprisingly effective. American pharmacists still sell painkillers loose in pots, enabling people to pour the whole lot down their throats in one movement. This is unwise. After Britain switched to blister packs in 1998, which require you to punch pills out one by one, deaths from overdoses of paracetamol (the active ingredient in Tylenol) dropped 44% in 11 years.Some who ponder suicide may be dissuaded by counselling. Behavioural therapies, alone or in family settings, allow sufferers to talk through their emotions and actions. A Danish study of 65,000 people who attempted suicide between 1992 and 2010 suggests that providing people with “a safe, confidential place to talk” during up to ten sessions saw repeat attempts and actual suicides drop more than 25%.Three states have concluded that not all suicides should be prevented. In Oregon, Washington and Vermont “Death with Dignity” laws allow terminally ill, mentally competent residents to ask for prescription drugs to hasten their deaths. Such laws have no discernible effect on unassisted suicide: from 1999 to 2010 suicides among those aged 35-64 increased 49% in Oregon, which has allowed terminally ill patients to end their lives since 1997, compared with a 28% increase nationally.And what of those left behind? A suicide deeply affects six people close to the deceased, research suggests. Since 1988 some 5m Americans have suffered the loss of a loved one in this way. Christy Simpson, a counsellor in Georgia, knows it can be difficult for families to discuss a loved one’s suicide; her mother asked her to tell friends that her sister died in a car accident after she jumped to her death.Ms Simpson believes that eroding the stigma around suicide would help. “My parents could never talk about [it]. My mother went from perfect health to her grave within seven years,” she says. “The message I got was that what had happened was extremely shameful and that we had failed as a family.”From the print edition: United StatesSubmit to redditinShare90View all comments (63)Add your commentMore from The EconomistThe female body: Shape-shiftingMale suicide: A worrying trendWhat Russia wants: From cold war to hot warAdultery in South Korea: Dead scarlet letterThe Economist explains: Why the oil price is fallingBrazil’s coming recession: The crash of a titanLand ownership: I had a farm in AfricaStudying languages: Shout louderButtonwood: False hopeWant more?
