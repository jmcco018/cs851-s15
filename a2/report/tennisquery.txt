Thanks to quality products like Butterfly TR26B Playback Rollaway Table Tennis Table, it is possible for enthusiasts and budding professionals alike to experience the joys of table tennis.Butterfly is known for making excellent tables without charging their customers exorbitant amounts of money. This particular model, immediately recognizable by its vivid blue hue, is one of the best options available in the sub $700 market. It is ideal as a first table for table tennis enthusiasts who may eventually want to move on to professional-grade tables.Main Features of the Butterfly Playback Rollaway Table Tennis TableThe most immediately noticeable feature of this folding table tennis table is the means by which it can be folded up and stored without removing the net. This is a helpful design element that, while not strictly necessary, makes using your tennis table easier – you do not have to take down the net every time you store the table and put it back on every time you want to play.The dimensions of the Butterfly table, once folded, are of 73.5 inches by 24.5 inches. In normal usage it is 108 inches long by 71 inches wide, with the same 73.5 inches of height. The table stands very straight and is joined using steel legs and connections that ensure long life and durability.The tabletop is finished with wood, providing a consistent, even bounce on all portions of the tabletop. It features two safety levers on each side of the table that provide effective measures of child safety, preventing the young ones from playing with the heavy metal frame.Benefits of Using the Butterfly TR26BThere are numerous advantages to be had by using this Butterfly table tennis table. Beyond the simple product specifications, which are enough to let you know the mundane physical aspects of the product, it has a few clever design elements worth mentioning:The bright blue tabletop is constructed with exceedingly high standards of quality. The surface is coated with a wooden finish that provides the right amount of bounce necessary for a good game of table tennis.The folding mechanism is designed for simplicity, and the foldable table tennis table can be conveniently put away in moments. It would be tempting to say that even a child can do it, but it would be dangerous to let them try, bringing up the next point…Unlike many other tables, the Butterfly Playback Rollaway features child safety levers that really work. While the mechanism is easy to figure out, young children will not be tempted to try for themselves, potentially saving fingers and bones.The manufacturer provides a three year warranty against defects, which include the possibility of an uneven playing surface. If your table begins to warp unnaturally despite you taking the very best care of it, Butterfly will cover the cost of replacement or repair for you.Disadvantages to This Butterfly Playback RollawayNo product is perfect, and this Butterfly table is no exception to the rule. While it performs admirably under a variety of indoor conditions, this table does suffer from a couple of drawbacks:If you are looking for a table to use in an outdoor area, this is probably not the ideal table for you. Granted, the Butterfly Playback Rollaway series is advertised as an indoor table, so you should know that what you are buying is not designed for outdoor use beforehand.Table assembly may take some individuals a fair share of time. My personal experience went by perfectly fine, but I am used to building and collapsing these kinds of table tennis tables, so it would be fair to warn that a newcomer may have to invest a couple of hours in the process.My Experience with This Butterfly Table Tennis TableSince I have quite a bit of experience with various types of table tennis tables, I was quickly able to get a grasp on how this one responds to play. The top of this Butterfly Rollaway table tennis table is very even and consistent, and would do nicely for any friendly table tennis game or amateur player.The net is well attached to the board of the table, which is a great help. I have seen some net-less tables as a result of being designed with a poor attachment apparatus. Butterfly, however, knows well how to design a table to function correctly and without issues.Assembling the table was simple enough – if you do not have an electric hand drill, you should borrow or purchase one, because I could see this being a pretty lengthy procedure without the help of a tool like that. If you have an electric hand drill, however, you are perfectly ready to assemble it and you can do so quickly and easily.As far as the table’s responsiveness to play is concerned, I would see it as being an ideal table for a school or recreation center. It is good enough to introduce a new player to the sport and to have them become an adept player, but there is a significant difference between this table and a tournament-level one.For its price, however, the Butterfly TR26B is perfect for introducing new players, training amateurs, and developing interest in the sport. The board is flat and consistent, and the steel frame is even and totally devoid of undesired wobble. It performs spectacularly in playback mode, as well.The Verdict: Worth Purchasing For Your Home, School or GymIf you are looking for a high quality, effective table tennis table that will do well inside your home, then this is a great investment to make. Likewise, if you are in charge of requesting sports equipment for a school, university or gymnasium, then this table should probably be at the top of your list.There are definitely better tables available on the market, but if you are not looking for tournament-ready performance, you can benefit from the value-on-the-dollar represented by the Butterfly TR26B Playback Rollaway Table Tennis Table. Not many other tennis tables on the market offer as much as this one does for such a low price.Be Sociable, Share!inShare0Related posts:Ping Pong Table Reviews: Butterfly TR26 Playback Rollaway Table Tennis TablePing Pong Table Reviews: Butterfly TW24B Outdoor Playback Rollaway Table Tennis TablePing Pong Table Reviews: Butterfly TR21 Personal Rollaway Table Tennis TablePing Pong Table Reviews: Butterfly TR16 Home Rollaway Table Tennis Table       Product Image- 9%Butterfly TR26B Playback Rollaway Table Tennis Table (Blue)Hathaway Bounce Back Table Tennis Table, Blue- 19%STIGA InstaPlay Table Tennis Table $699.99$769.99$307.99$569.99$699.99 DetailsDetailsDetailsBrand:ButterflyHathawaySTIGAColor:BlueBlueblackItem Dimensions:71 x 73.5 x 108 in1.9 lb60 x 30 x 108 in113 lb60 x 64 x 108 in1 lbLabel:ButterflyBlue Wave Products (dropship)STIGAModel:TR26BBG2325T8288Package Dimensions:55 x 4.5 x 61 in180 lb58 x 4.8 x 62 in198 lb55.5 x 6.5 x 62.5 in263 lbRelease Date:2006-10-20  Size:One Size One SizeManufacturer Minimum Age:  96 DetailsDetailsDetailsProduct prices and availability are accurate as of 03/03/2015 20:39 UTC but are subject to change.Any price and availability information displayed on the merchant site at the time of purchase will apply to the purchase of this product.Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

The only catch is that we have limited quantities of these fixed-price items, and at these great prices, they won't last long. Once they're gone, they're gone.We update featured deals at least once a day starting at 8 a.m. Pacific Time. And when we sell out of items during the day, we replace them with brand new deals. On newer deals you'll see a message that says something like \"Added 2 hours ago\" to let you know it's a fresh offer. Check back often to make sure you don't miss out on the latest Daily Deals.Questions and AnswersQ.How is the discount on each Daily Deal item determined?A.The price that is stricken is the \"List Price\" for the item. The List price is the price (excluding shipping and handling fees) the seller of the item has provided at which the same item, or one that is nearly identical to it, is being offered for sale or has been offered for sale in the recent past. The price may be the seller's own price elsewhere or another seller's price. The \"% off\" simply signifies the calculated percentage difference between seller-provided List Price and the seller's price for the Daily Deal item. If you have any questions related to the pricing and/or discount offered in the Daily Deal, please contact the seller.Q.Is it really free shipping?A.Absolutely. All Daily Deals have free shipping, always. Cool, huh?Q.Does each Daily Deal last an entire day?A.Not always. When we sell out, the deal is over. If you see something you want, you'll want to grab it quickly. If you love it, chances are others will too, and we only have so many to go around. Also, eBay may for any reason, such as making room for another great deal, take down a deal before it sells out or before the end of the day.Q.How often are Daily Deals updated?A.We start fresh every morning with four new deals at 8 a.m. Pacific Time. As these items sell out, we replace them with new offers throughout the day, so it's always a good time to check out eBay Daily Deals.Q.How do I know if an item is selling out?A.All Daily Deals items are available for a limited time and in limited quantities. If you see something that catches your eye, pick it up before it sells out. We even have a small \"Almost gone!\" banner that lets you know when an item is almost sold out.Q.What is a \"done deal\"?A.If you see a deal marked \"done deal\", the item has already sold out. Check eBay Daily Deals often to make sure you get your item before it becomes a done deal.Q.Can I purchase multiple quantities of an eBay Deals listing?A. For each eBay Deals listing, a maximum number of units can be purchased. For example, if the maximum allowed is five, you canâ€™t purchase more than this amount. This includes registering new accounts or using other existing accounts to purchase more than the allowed limit. Violations will result in warnings, restrictions, and/or suspension.Please refer to our Site Interference Policy for more information.Additional site navigationCommunityAbout eBayAnnouncementsSecurity CenterResolution CenterSeller Information CenterPoliciesSite MapeBay official timePreview new featuresContact usTell us what you thinkeBay Money Back GuaranteeCopyright Â© 1995-2015 eBay Inc.
