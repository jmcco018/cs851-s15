The year also saw three different team principals, while Sergio Marchionne replaced Luca Di Montezemolo as president.The team is looking to the new Ferrari SF15-T to restore its fortunes.\"The best car is the winning car,\" team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said on Friday. \"Last year, we had an ugly car, and it was a non-winning car on top of this. I like the car this year, in terms of aesthetics. I don t know about the performance but it s really sexy.\"While Arrivabene does not expect Ferrari to end its seven-year wait for a title, he has reiterated his demand for at least two grand prix triumphs this season.\"I m just realistic,\" he said. \"Nobody has the magic to change things when things are unchangeable.\"We applied certain modifications that in our opinion are quite interesting. With that, I don t want to say we are going to win the world championship, but for sure we are committed at least to win two races.\"The most striking features of the car are the elongated nose and heavily revised sidepods, and technical director James Allison said they have \"made a very useful leap\" in both the car design and the engine.\"No one ever said Formula One was supposed to be easy,\" Allison added. \"It will be a very stiff challenge to win races in 2015, but we have made good steps forward over the whole car, and we hope that this work will translate into a notable step forward in our fortunes.\"It is hoped the arrival of Vettel, who won four straight world titles from 2010-13, will also rejuvenate the team.\"There is a change in color for me so it s a new experience, but the car looks beautiful,\" Vettel said. \"I can t wait to go on track and see how it feels.\"There is a lot of change going on, a lot of new people in new positions including myself, and it always takes a bit of time to settle in until you really start to make proper progress. I m confident that we are going in the right direction, but it would be wrong to immediately expect a lot of us.\"Vettel, who also had a disappointing 2014, replaced another former world champion in Fernando Alonso. The German will be the first to drive the SF15-T when he takes to the wheel for the first winter test in Jerez on Sunday.\"The most important is that we start getting into the groove quickly in winter testing, and then we start to make progress,\" Vettel added. \"If the situation is like last year, it will be very difficult to really fight for victories, but of course it is our goal, and that s why we re here. We re not here to finish second.\"For us, the main target is to start to really work together, and hopefully catch up more and more as the season progresses.\"Ferrari believes it will show a clear improvement in performance from its power unit, starting with the first race in Melbourne in mid-March.\"The increase in performance is significant, but probably still not enough to be at the top level,\" said the head of Ferrari s power unit department, Mattia Binotto. \"It will be difficult to be at Mercedes  level right from Australia. They have such a huge advantage. It s our aim to reach the top teams before the end of the season.\"Recent articlesNBA: Nuggets sack coach Shaw after poor start: reports2015-03-03Football: Bayern's Guardiola dimisses Man City rumours2015-03-03Formula One: Williams confirm Wolff test schedule2015-03-03France lock Pape loses appeal against 10-week suspension2015-03-03AdvertismentLeave commentPlease enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered by Disqus.</a>comments powered by DisqusWatchLiveProgramscheduleLatest VideosBlind team doesn't have stadium to play cricketFrom selling tea at Railway station to Prime Minister house, Haroon Rasheed tells Narendra Modi's stAt this age, Shehreyar Khan should worry about his afterlife: Sarfaraz Nawaz123PreviousNextNewsHeadlinePakistanWorldSportsCricketBusinessEntertainmentTechnologyCrimeWeird NewsNews ArchiveProgramsHasb-e-HaalMazaq RaatNuqta NazarOn The FrontSiasat Hai Ya SazishIkhtilafi NoteFollow UpKhabar Yeh HayPeyam-E-SubhDunya TV SpecialYaad Karti Hay DunyaSawalIlm-O-HikmatToolsLive StreamingRadioiPhone APPMobileSubscribe Email For News AlertCorporateFeedbackDistributionCareersContact UsScheduleWallpapersRingtonesAdvertise With UsJoin UsTwitterFacebookRSSHomeFeedbackDistributionCareersContact UsNews Archive© 2014 Dunya News Network.

What you need to know about insurance before moving.By Staff WriterSo you’ve decided to abandon the old homestead for greener pastures. Or possibly a job is transferring you around the state or across the country. Or the kids have outgrown the apartment so it is on to a house.Whatever the reason, hundreds of thousands of Americans will move from one residence to another this year. That’s a lot of personal belongings being packed up, shoved in, and moved out. If you suffer damage to your property during this process, are you covered by your homeowners insurance? Your car insurance? The mover’s insurance?Let’s address them one at a time.Homeowners InsuranceA traditional homeowners policy will typically cover your property while in transit just as if it was still located in your living room, and for up to 30 days at your new home. That will give you plenty of time to make the necessary changes in your homeowners insurance to protect your new home. There are a few limitations that apply to certain property during your move, but none of them are related to the fact you are moving. These limitations apply to the following types of property anytime it is away from your home for any reason.Except for certain limitations, the full amount of personal property coverage you have at your home will also apply while your goods are being relocated. Talk to your Trusted Choice® insurance professional for more details about limitations.The typical homeowners policy only covers your property, no matter the location, for certain causes of loss known as perils. What if something happens to your property that is not due to one of these causes? There is no policy coverage for that damage.One example while moving would be breakage due to items being bumped or dropped. Check with your insurance agent to be sure exactly what types of perils your policy provides, and where the gaps might be for damage while moving. If you are concerned about those gaps your agent can help you determine the appropriate coverage.Moving CompanyYour moving company will typically carry coverage for damages that occurs due to their negligence. So, if an item gets dropped and broken by one of the movers, you can look to the moving company’s insurance to pay for it.Be aware, however, that the basic coverage moving companies must provide by law is only $.60 per pound of the shipment. So if a $500 stereo that weighs thirty pounds is damaged, a mover might pay just $18 (30 lbs. x $.60). Many professional moving companies offer up to three higher levels of coverage, all at an additional fee. Be certain to ask the movers what options they offer, and the price, to purchase broader supplemental coverage.For information on choosing a professional moving company, check out the American Moving and Storage Association Web site at www.moving.org.Auto InsuranceThe liability portion of your auto policy has an exclusion for damage to your own property. Otherwise, every time you needed a new TV, you could just set it in the driveway behind your car, rev up the engine, shift into reverse, and voila! New television! Any further doubts as to why that exclusion is in there?The physical damage coverages in your auto policy are also no help, since they cover the auto and its equipment, not any of your clothing or household goods have in the back seat or trunk.These exclusions within your auto insurance are usually not a problem, since the idea is for you to get coverage for any damage to your goods while in the car from your homeowners policy.One more thing. Be sure to give your Trusted Choice® insurance professional a call before you start packing those boxes. They will be happy to make sure your coverage is updated for the new house, change the address on your policies, and probably offer you brochures on planning for a safe move—plus suggestions for making your new home secure and accident free.Enjoy the move!This entry was posted on Fri Nov 25 10:34:00 EST 2011 and filed under Am I covered?, Familyand Travel.

Such data often get shared, and underlie popular services such as Google’s real-time traffic monitoring, which shows conditions on major thoroughfares in more than 50 different countries.However, anonymized data can still reveal a great deal about individuals. For example, computational social scientist Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye at MIT and his colleagues recently found that anonymized cell phone data could be better at identifying users than fingerprints. At most, 11 randomly chosen interactions with cell phone networks were needed to identify a person by the routes he or she regularly traveled, while identifying someone by a fingerprint requires at least 12 reference points.To see how well anonymized credit card data protected privacy, de Montjoye and his colleagues at MIT and Aarhus University in Denmark analyzed three months' worth of information from 1.1 million people living in an unidentified developed country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED). They detailed their findings in the Jan. 30 issue of the journal Science.The researchers found that knowing when and where four credit card transactions occurred was enough to identify 90 percent of people from this anonymized metadata. Even when the data are less specific — for instance, purchases within a certain geographic area instead of a certain shop, or within 15 days instead of one day — individuals could be re-identified with a half-dozen or so more additional data points. Adding one more piece of data, the price of a certain transaction, could increase the chance of re-identification by 22 percent on average. Women and people in higher income brackets proved easier to identify, potentially because they have distinctive patterns in how they divide their time between the shops they visit.Although data sharing can provide invaluable services, these findings suggest \"we ought to rethink and reform how we approach data protection,\" de Montjoye said. He and his colleagues are now developing strategies known as OpenPDS and SafeAnswers to protect the privacy of metadata, which recently won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.Learn MoreGoogle TrafficOpenPDSanonymized datacredit cardsidentitymetadataprivacy Share| Email| PrintCommentsComment PolicyPlease enable JavaScript to view the <ahref=\"http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered byDisqus.</a>Advertisement<a href=\"http://nym1.ib.adnxs.com/click?AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQPYoXI_CdSFAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQCk4tj8SkioYyOGNDfGVmRQpGfZUAAAAAIGHCQDoAAAA6AAAAAIAAACDBHUBKWMBAAAAAQBVU0QAVVNEACwB-gAcAQAAfMcAAgMAAQIAAAAA9RW4_AAAAAA./cnd=%217wWfOAiy26sDEIOJ1AsYqcYFIAQ./referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fspectrum.ieee.org%2Ftech-talk%2Ftelecom%2Fsecurity%2Fidentifying-credit-card-users-with-a-few-bits-of-data/clickenc=http%3A%2F%2Fadrta.com%2Fc%3Fclid%3Dbz%26paid%3Dapn%26avid%3D440257%26caid%3D7007666%26plid%3D24446083%26adSize%3D300x250%26cb%3D1425414441%26redirect%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.vcu.edu%2Femba%2Finfo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"250\" style=\"border-style: none\" src=\"http://cdn.adnxs.com/p/47/f2/b0/80/47f2b08022000bff6e8def8702cda26c.gif\"/></a><a href=\"http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/f.site220.tmus/telecom;pos=1;sz=300x250;ord=123456789?\" target=\"_blank\" ><img src=\"http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/f.site220.tmus/telecom;pos=1;sz=300x250;ord=123456789?\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></a>Tech TalkIEEE Spectrum’s general technology blog, featuring news, analysis, and opinions about engineering, consumer electronics, and technology and society, from the editorial staff and freelance contributors.Subscribe to RSS Feed Newsletter Sign UpSign up for the Tech Alert newsletter and receive ground-breaking technology and science news from IEEE Spectrum every Thursday.Sign UpRelated Stories  TelecomIs the Lenovo/Superfish Debacle a Call to Arms for Hacktivists?Proposed exemptions to the DMCA could free white hats to make networked devices more secure26 Feb  TelecomHow to Build a Safer Internet of ThingsToday's IoT is full of security flaws.

While we're still far from teaching robots complicated skills using just a playlist of YouTube clips, a University of Maryland research team is in the very early stages of making that happen. The team's research is funded by DARPA's Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Execution (MSEE) program, which aims to teach machines not only how to collect data, but also how to act on it. For this particular study, the researchers have developed a system that allowed their test robots to learn from a series of \"how-to\" cooking videos on YouTube. During testing, the robots were able to perform the tasks shown in the videos using the right utensils and with zero human input.In addition, the system gives robots the ability to store whatever they've learned from the videos and to build on the knowledge to become better at handing certain tools or performing certain tasks. DARPA believes the robots could eventually learn a lot faster at a fraction of what it currently costs due to this research, especially since it could also allow them to share their knowledge with other machines. We just hope they don't end up becoming sentient and colluding against us. Want to know more? If you don't mind sifting through a document filled with scientific lingo, feel free to pore over University of Maryland's paper for more info.Source: DARPA, University of Maryland (PDF)Tags: DARPA, robot, UniversityOfMaryland, video, youtube Hide Comments23Comments659323153656593231536523 commentsGet LivefyreFAQSign in1 person listening  + FollowSharePost comment as...Custom HTML PreviewLoadingNewest | Oldest | Top CommentsundefinedNew CommentsRefreshjorge1170xyz 5ptsFeaturedJan 31, 2015Those arms look perfect for skull crushing obsolete humans lolFlagShareLikeReplyodipedi 5ptsFeaturedJan 31, 2015please don't let them watch porrn !!!FlagShareLikeReplyodipedi 5ptsFeaturedJan 31, 2015or disney ...FlagShareLikeReplyShow More CommentsFeatured StoriesNikon Coolpix P900 point-and-shoot has a monstrous 83x zoom1 day ago  25Nikon's latest lightweight DSLR is the D72001 day ago  29Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 can take phone calls even when upside down2 days ago  27HTC's Grip fitness tracker is a promising, puzzling first step2 days ago  6HTC One M9 preview: A battle between polish and progress2 days ago  153Huawei's second-generation wearable gets a stylish makeover2 days ago  8HP teamed up with Microsoft to build its latest flagship laptop2 days ago  115Sponsored LinksGet this amazing value$79.99/mo. + taxes, equip. charges, FDV & other fees w/2-yr. agmt.verizon.comVirginia's NEW RULENew Car Insurance Rule in Virginia Has Drivers Furious!SmarterLifeDaily.com1 Trick FIGHTS Hair Loss\"Breakthrough\" Hair Loss Method Leaves 1000s Wondering..
